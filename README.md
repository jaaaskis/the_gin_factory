# The Gin Factory
Digital Service Design course project. 

## Description
This was a group project done for the digital service design course. 
The main goal here was to create a visually pleasing page following web design principles. Hand drawn images, botanicals, cogs etc. were done by a group member.
The design was the most important part of the project, but we decided to do some functionality to it too. Total time spent on this was 3 weeks.
